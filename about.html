                       In the future I plan to become a software developer of some sort, whether it be for my own company or somebody else's. I am currently studying very hard in high school in order to be able to be admitted in to a UC school. I plan on studying computer science and possibly data science, as that field has many opportunities. I am currently learning the basics of computer science on my own time and have spent some time developing my own projects at home. This is something that I find very fun to do in my freetime and I would love to pursue it as a career.

                       I am an extremely hard worker and I am also very organized with the way that I do things. In addition to this class, I am enrolled in AP US History and AP Language and Composition. These rigorous classes require me to be very disciplined and also are very challenging. The hard work and discipline that I apply to my other classes directly translates into computer science. Learning computer science requires a lot of discipline and the opportunities I have been provided with are preparing me to do so.
                       <br></br><br></br>
                       Besides being an extremely hard worker, I am also a leader. Over the summer I had the opportunity to participate in the Link Crew program at Palm Desert High School. In this program we were tasked with introducing the incoming freshman to their new school. There were many challenges to overcome however this opportunity had provided me with the chance to improve myself as a leader overall. Although I have not taken many opportunities to improve upon my leadership skills in the past, I plan on attending the Rotary Youth Leadership Awards camp this winter as well as participating in the Associated Student Body next school year.
