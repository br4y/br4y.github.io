        <u>Education</u><br>
        I am currently enrolled in Palm Desert High School, located in Palm Desert, California. I have studied at Palm Desert High School for two years, and am currently a junior. I am currently enrolled in Computer Science Principles, AP English Language and Composition, and AP United States History. I have previously took AP Human Geography and AP World History and scored a 4 on both tests. I have also maintained above a 4.0 GPA (weighted) throughout each semester of school. After high school, I plan to study computer science at Univeristy of California San Diego or University of California Santa Barbara, however these two choices are not final.
