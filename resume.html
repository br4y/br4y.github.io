        <u>Work/Voulenteer Experience</u><br>
        In the past I have voulenteered at 3 robotics workshop fundraisers hosted at Palm Desert Charter Middle School. At this fundraiser, I taught children the basics of how to build and program their own EV3 robots. For the past two consecutive years I have also voulenteered at a track meet held for senior citizens hosted by the Young Men's Christian Association at Palm Desert High School. I also have had the opportunity to participate in a program called Link Crew, in which myself and many other upperclassmen organized the freshman orientation for the class of '23. I have also tutored math 1 students and helped them revise their exams in order to be able to improve their scores on a retake. I have participated and competed in Track and Field at Palm Desert High School my freshman and sophomore year.
