            <p>Python Project: Hangman</p>
            <p>This project was created by myself, James Connor and Megan Clapinski using a website called <a href="repl.it">Repl.it</a>. This website allows multiple users to contribute to one live project.</p>
            <p>My group and I struggled to track the number of incorrect guesses because the function we used to check if a guess was incorrect would use one string that would be added on to over time. We fixed this issue by creating two seperate strings and creating another seperate function to track incorrect guesses.</p>
            <p>My group also struggled to properly implement a while loop that controlled whether or not the game was running. The while loop previously contained a condition dependent on the number of guesses, but we changed the while loop to run based off of user input.</p>
